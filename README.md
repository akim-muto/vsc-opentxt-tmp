# File Watcher Issues on vscode with windows

If you open a file that has been detected as having been changed by the onDidChange event generated by File Watcher using openTextDocument, the latest changes may not be reflected.
If you insert sleep, it will be fine for practical purposes, but it won't be clear.

After digging through the archives, it seems that File Watcher have causing problems.

Does anyone have a good solution?

## Steps to Reproduce

Platform:windows

1. `git clone https://github.com/akim-muto/vsc-opentxt-tmp`

5. run command `testVsc.start`
6. change and save `media/test.txt`
